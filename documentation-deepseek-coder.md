 The provided code snippet appears to be a part of an ASP.NET Core web API controller that handles document upload requests. It includes various error handling mechanisms and integrates with external services for virus scanning and domain-specific business logic. Below, I'll summarize the key components and functionalities of this code snippet:

### Key Functionalities:
1. **Document Upload**: The endpoint accepts a multipart form data request containing one or more documents to be uploaded. Each document is scanned for viruses before being processed further.
2. **Virus Scanning**: Uses an external virus scanning service (`_virusScanner`) to check each uploaded document for potential malware. If any document is infected, the upload process is halted and a `400 Bad Request` response is returned.
3. **Business Logic Integration**: The documents are processed according to specific agreement rules (handled by `_domainService`), which includes checking the status of the associated agreement (`agreement`) and handling any custom clause limits or merge document exceptions that may arise.
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms for different types of exceptions, including custom business logic errors, external service failures, user input issues, and internal server errors. Each exception type is caught, logged, and a corresponding HTTP response status code (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for internal server errors) is returned to the client.

### Code Structure:
- **POST Method**: The `UploadDocumentAsync` method handles the actual document upload process. It uses an asynchronous approach (`await Task.WhenAll`) to scan multiple documents concurrently and processes them in a try-catch block to handle exceptions gracefully.
- **Virus Scanning**: A helper method `ScanDocument` is used to check each document's content against the virus scanner service.
- **Response Handling**: The response is standardized across all API endpoints using a custom `CreateResponse` method that formats the JSON response based on whether it contains data or not.

### Error Codes and Messages:
- **400 Bad Request**: Used for malformed requests, invalid user inputs, virus scan failures, and other client errors.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Handled for internal service errors (e.g., database issues, unexpected exceptions), which are logged and then rethrown as a `CMException.DependencyException`.
- **404 Not Found**: Thrown if the specified agreement is not found (`AgreementNotFoundException`).

### Exception Handling:
- Specific business logic exceptions like `InvalidAgreementStatusException`, `UserInputException`, etc., are caught and mapped to appropriate HTTP error codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests) with custom messages.
- Exceptions from external services or dependencies are logged and wrapped in a more general `CMException.DependencyException` before being rethrown as internal server errors (`500`).

### Logging:
- Exception details, including error codes, messages, request details, and operation information, are logged using the provided logger interface for future debugging and monitoring.

This code snippet effectively demonstrates how to manage document uploads in a secure and robust manner, ensuring that both data integrity (virus scanning) and business rules compliance (agreement handling) are upheld.
