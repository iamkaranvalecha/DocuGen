This is a C# code file that contains a controller method for uploading documents in a specific agreement. The method is called `PostUploadDocumentAsync` and it's an asynchronous HTTP POST request handler.

Here are the main points of this method:

1. It verifies the Mcapi authorization with the customer ID.
2. It checks if the customer ID and agreement number are not null or empty.
3. It retrieves the agreement from a domain service using the customer ID and agreement number.
4. It scans each uploaded document for viruses using a virus scanner.
5. If any of the documents contain viruses, it returns a 400 Bad Request response.
6. It maps the upload request to a POCO UploadDocuments object.
7. It sets the modified date, modified by, and document type on each upload document.
8. It uploads the documents to the domain service using the agreement.
9. If any errors occur during the uploading process, it catches the exceptions and returns an error response.

The method also includes logging and error handling for various types of exceptions, including virus scan failures, malformed requests, and internal server errors.
