# Visual Studio Code Extension for Documentation Generation

## Repository Need
This VS Code extension requires a repository containing source code that users want to document. The goal is to scan and generate documentation based on user-defined criteria related to the level of detail (e.g., Function, File, Folder) within this repository's structure. Here are key features:

### Repository Scanning Process with User Input for Documentation Detail Level
1. **Selection Interface** - Prompt users in Visual Studio Code extension environment and allow them to select the level of documentation they wish to generate (Function, File or Folder). This ensures that generated docs meet user's expectations regarding scope and depth:
   - Function-Level Documentation – Detailed descriptions for individual functions.
   - File-Level Documentation– General overviews with specific mentions on each file’s role within the project structure if necessary information is provided by users about their intended use cases or purpose of these files in a larger context (e.g., "This Python module handles data preprocessing as per Project Specifications").
   - Folder-Level Documentation – Summaries providing an understanding on how different parts fit together within the overall project organization and workflow, typically when there's complex folder structure or multiple components being used in conjunction with each other. 
2. **User Repository Description Prompt**: Using system prompt questions to request user input about their repository summary including what purpose it serves (e.g., "This is a library for statistical analysis and data visualization."). This information helps contextualize generated documentation, making them more relevant & understandable especially when they are meant as part of larger project documents or guides:
3. **Documentation Generation Flow** - Once the user selects their desired level(s) (Function/File/Folder), feed all selected files into a predefined model that generates corresponding summaries and descriptions on-the-fly based upon repository structure, syntaxes used & possible functionalities derived from these sources:
   i. **Documentation Processing** - The extension processes through each chosen file(s) to extract meaningful information such as function names/parameters or module purpose within the codebase; this might involve using AI-based approaches (like Natural Language Generation). 
    ii. **Output File Creation and Management: Once generated, summaries are written into a new output document that's either saved locally in user’s machine directory chosen by them for further review or distributed according to their preference settings within the extension itself. This feature ensures an organized approach where users can easily access created documentation files without having to sift through unwanted content:
4. **Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement** - Post-creation, there's a suggestion for user feedback on generated contents (missing information or errors) which helps refine the model used in generating docs over time – improving accuracy & comprehensiveness of created documentation with each usage cycle:
    This VS Code extension not only promotes codebase readability but also makes understanding complex software systems easier by providing succinct and contextually relevant summaries/descriptions generated from repository files (functions, modules etc.). By actively involving user input in its operation flow & continual learning through feedback mechanisms – it offers a dynamic tool that can evolve to better serve users' needs over time.

In summary, this VS Code extension serves as an efficient solution for automatically documenting code repositories by integrating system prompts and active use-case context understanding into the generation process flow; all tailored around user preferences when selecting desired documentation levels (Function/File/Folder). It offers seamless feedback loop mechanism which enhances its ability to provide increasingly accurate summaries with each usage cycle - thus effectively helping developers understand complex software systems quickly & easily.
